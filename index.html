        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p> Hello, My name is Henry Martinez. I recently finished sophomore grade in Orthopaedic Medical Magnet High.</p>
        <p> I know some coding, but hope to improve on with this skill. </p>
    
        <h3>Who do I want to become?  </h3>
        <p> I would like to start becoming a person who is able to be motivated. I would not want to keep pretending to be viewed as a person with no dreams or creativity, but want to begin making an impact. Overall, I hope I can try to become not only a programmer, but being an icon. I want to be this person that will answer questions quickly and stand up for myself. </p>
